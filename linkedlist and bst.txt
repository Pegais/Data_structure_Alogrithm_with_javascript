Exercise 1: Create a program that accepts the student data as input from the user. The student data should contain the following information:

●       Student id

●       Student name

●       Student marks of 5 subjects

Store this information in a tree data structure where each node represents a single student. The tree should be a binary search tree and use the percentage of each student as criteria for storing objects. After storing all the information, the user will enter the name of a student and his/her grades should be displayed on the screen.

 

Exercise 2:

Create a program in which users can enter customer data. The customer data should contain the following information:

●       Customer Id

●       Customer Name

●       Purchase date(dd/mm/yy)

●       Bill amount

Store this information in a linked list. The program should provide three different options for viewing information:

●       View all customer data in sorted order based on bill amount

●       View total purchase amount for a specific year

●       View details of a specific customer based on name
